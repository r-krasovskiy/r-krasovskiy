Hi there,
<p>Iâ€™m currently learning Python with some application in data science - statistical analysis and machine learning.
  <br>My accomplished and current projects are listed in the table below with links at appropriate datasets and scripts. I assume they will be pretty useful to other newbies because cover most of common problems and solutions especially business-related ones (clusterization, forecasting, modelling etc.) 
</p>
<p>P.S.: I have also some experience with JS (and of course with HTML and CSS). Apropriate repositories can be found below.</p>

<br>

> <b>My CV is availble <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1wiQ9PNbKDWzqyKveq5FxwT7W68CHhYjs/view?usp=sharing">here</a></b>.
