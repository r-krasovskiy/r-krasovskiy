Hi there,
<p>Iâ€™m currently learning Python with some application in data science - statistical analysis and machine learning.
  <br>My accomplished and current projects are listed in the table below with links at appropriate datasets and scripts. I assume they will be pretty useful to other newbies becouse cover most of common problems and solutions especially in different business fields (clusterization, forecasting, modelling etc.) 
</p>
<p>P.S.: I have also some experience with JS. Apropriate repositories can be found below as well.</p>
